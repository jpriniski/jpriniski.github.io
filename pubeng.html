<a target = '_blank' href="https://twitter.com/collthinking420?s=20&t=fJboH5MyTomxbH_qQEv_dw">Collective Thinking</a> is a press and art/research collective centered in Los Angeles, California 
		    focused on fostering community-driven science and technology. We build technologies that advance a more equitable science, not insane levels of profit. 
		    You can view the collective's first citizen science project, <a target = '_blank' href="ucmywages.com">ucmywages.com</a>, which is an interactive data visualization tool for facilitating discussion about UC employee salaries during wage negotiations regarding the UC graduate student strike. 
		    The data viz tool serves to facilitate discussion about labor in academia and demonstrates how data science can be used for social good.

Predictive algorithm and data visualization in Logan Wolfe's MFA mid-residency review (Jan. 12th, 2023). CalArts, LA, California. <a target = '_blank' href="https://youtu.be/lKEBJAgRGFw">https://youtu.be/lKEBJAgRGFw</a> <br><br>

Hardware: Mac Mini, television screen, philips hue smart light. <br><br>
Software: Python, Pandas, Plotly, Phue. <br><br>

The algorithm predicts a subject's latitude and longitude at time of observation using privately gathered data and plots the predicted location on a digital map. A green light illuminates when the subject is home. <br><br>

The algorithm uses time and memory to predict the subject's behavior. Predicting another's intentions divides and separates us. Memory's error explodes with time, but our theories make no space for probabilistic uncertainty. We know less as time moves forward, but do our beliefs fade too? <br><br>

What establishes an ethic for surveillance in a digital age, when billion dollar corporations track and monetize our most intimate patterns? And what constitutes consent when we let out private behavior be transformed to divide and unsettle? <br><br>
Algorithms categorize, divide and separate. Data is a mechanism of invasion, destruction, and control. Scientists, engineers, artists, and the public must appreciate how privacy deteriorates as technology sinks its hooks deeper into our lives. <br><br>
