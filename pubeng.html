        <h2>AI system for modeling beliefs from natural language data</h2>

	<p align="justify">
        With computer scientists at USC I developed an artificial intelligence system that identities causal claims made in natural language. The model then references similar documents based on the content of their causal claims to produce a causal topic network. The state-of-the-art system is based on a large language model trained to identify instances of causal language, and was demonstrated at last summer's Association for Computational Linguistics. You can follow <a target = '_blank' href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-demo.41/"> this tutorial</a> to use the system to analyze causal language in a corpus by following this link: <a target = '_blank' href="causal-claims.isi.edu">causal-claims.isi.edu</a>.

			Predictive algorithm and data visualization piece with Logan Wolfe (CalArts MFA). <a target = '_blank' href="https://youtu.be/lKEBJAgRGFw">https://youtu.be/lKEBJAgRGFw</a> <br><br>

			Hardware: Mac Mini, television screen, philips hue smart light. <br><br>
			Software: Python, Pandas, Plotly, Phue. <br><br>

			The algorithm predicts the subject's latitude and longitude at time of observation using privately gathered data, and plots the prediction on a digital map. A green light illuminates when the subject is home. <br><br>

			The algorithm uses time and memory to predict the subject's behavior. Predicting another's intentions divides and separates us. Memory's error explodes with time, but our theories make no space for probabilistic uncertainty. We know less as time moves forward, but do our beliefs fade too? <br><br>

			What establishes an ethic for surveillance in a digital age, when billion dollar corporations track and monetize our most intimate patterns? And what constitutes consent when our private behavior is transformed to divide and unsettle? <br><br>

			Algorithms categorize, divide, and separate. Data is a mechanism of invasion and control. Scientists, engineers, artists, and the public must appreciate how privacy deteriorates as technology sinks its hooks deeper into our lives. <br><br>
