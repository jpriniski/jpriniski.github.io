<h3>üìÑ Project Overview</h3>
<p>While narratives have shaped human beliefs and cultures for centuries, the internet has introduced new narrative phenomena. Long-standing cognitive psychology paradigms and computer science methodologies are poorly equipped to study digital forms of narrative interaction and networked communication.</p>
<p>This project investigates how <strong>social network structure</strong>, <strong>narrative content</strong>, and communication contexts influence the formation and convergence of shared narratives in digital environments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large-scale behavioral experiments</strong> in custom-built online social networks</li>
<li><strong>AI-based network simulations</strong> with LLM-powered generative agents <strong>(LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, Gemma)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Develop novel natural language modeling</strong> approaches to quantify individual and group-level narrative alignment and belief dynamics</li>
</ul>

<h3>üí° Key Findings</h3>
<strong> Spatially-embedded network structures produce echochambers while fully-connected structures produce shared behaviors</strong>

         Left: Network structure with player nodes sized by participants‚Äô final rewards for coordinating (range (top) 0-25; (bottom) 0-19). Right: Colormap of individual responses, rows represent individual participants‚Äô set of responses, columns represent trials. Cells encode the first five letters of the generated hashtag.

        Onset of behavioral coherence during networked interaction. Panels display the proportion of each groupadopting a dominant response over course of interaction by group size (columns) and interaction media content (rows). Each
line represents a single experimental run from a group of participants, and each point represents the proportion of the group
reporting the most common response (which can change trial to trial for a given experimental run).

        Dynamics of individual decision strategy during networked interaction. Each panel illustrates the temporal
        dynamics of the proportion of each group adopting one of the four decision strategies (sampling new responses, repeating a
        partner‚Äôs last response, repeating one‚Äôs own previous response, and resampling from earlier context) across 40 trials in different
        network structures (Spatially-embedded, Homogeneously-mixed) and interaction contents (Hashtag-matching, Face-naming).
        We code cases when both a partner and oneself produces the same response (i.e., a rewarded response) as repeat self. Each
        panel displays the proportion of participants choosing a particular strategy as a function of trial number, differentiated by group
        size (20, 50, 100). Displayed proportions are averaged across runs for a given size, structure, and content. As shown in the top
        panels, hashtag-matching networks sample new responses (red lines) for much longer than face-naming groups (bottom panels).
        In contrast, participants in face-naming group are more quick to adopt the self-consistent strategy (repeating oneself, depicted
        by the purple lines).

<h3>üéØ Why It Matters</h3>
<p>Shared and polarized narratives don‚Äôt emerge randomly, they evolve through <strong>networked interaction</strong>. Narrative interactions are shaped by individuals‚Äô <strong>causal background knowledge</strong>, the <strong>social rewards</strong> of aligning beliefs and behaviors with others, and the <strong>network topology</strong> (who can talk to who) of communication. This project explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why some groups converge on shared interpretations of information while others fragment</li>
<li>How digital environments including prompting instructions can facilitate group consensus rather than disagreement</li>
<li><strong>Business use case:</strong> Social platforms or media organizations can apply these findings to <strong>optimize content prompts or feed structures</strong> that encourage consensus, diversity, or specific forms of engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Research use case:</strong> Social scientists can use this paradigm to <strong>experimentally manipulate network properties</strong> and observe real-time narrative change and align human group behavior with simulation data from AI agents.</li>
</ul>

<h3>üß™ How It Works</h3>

        Experiment procedure and networked interaction tasks. The experimental design follows three blocks. We
highlight a single node (in yellow) to illustrate a single participant‚Äôs tasks through the procedure. In the pre-interaction block,
all participants read the Fukushima nuclear disaster narrative that encodes the graphical causal model illustrated. The causal
model was not presented to participants. Participants then wrote a tweet-like personal narrative about the disaster and generated
ten hashtags describing the event. Participants next entered a network interaction block where they communicated with network
neighbors. In the network interaction block, group communication varied as a function of network structure
(homogeneously-mixed vs spatially-embedded) and content of interaction (narrative interaction based on hashtag matching vs
control based on the Name Game from Centola and Baronchelli (2015)). Participants interacted with neighbors, randomly
chosen based on network structure, for 40 trials and received one point for each trial in which their response matched their
neighbor‚Äôs (the participant with the most points at the end of network interaction received a financial reward). In the
post-interaction block, participants wrote a personal narrative about the Fukushima nuclear disaster and ten more hashtags
describing the event.

<li><strong>Experimental Network Design:</strong>
      Participants interact in custom-built online social networks with two topologies:
        <ul>
<li><em>Homogeneous:</em> each node connected to all others</li>
<li><em>Spatial:</em> ring-lattice with four neighbors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Stimuli:</strong> Participants engage with narratives designed to elicit causal interpretations</li>
<li><strong>Hashtag Rounds (x40):</strong> Incentivized coordination tasks over 40 trials per network</li>
<li><strong>Natural Language Analysis:</strong> LLM-based semantic similarity of hashtags and personal narratives used to track group-level belief alignment</li>
<li><strong>Multilevel Bayesian Modeling:</strong> Predicts hashtag convergence, group entropy, and narrative content as a function of network conditions</li>
<li><strong>Simulated Generative Agents:</strong> LLM based networks can simulate trends to replicate experimental outcomes</li>
