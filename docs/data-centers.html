<div class="subheader">The Cloud Is Our Demise</div>

The world lives in our phones and laptops. We have unfettered access to all data. For this, we grant imperial overlords free access to our data. Data that tracks our insecurities and ambitions, our goals, and expressions of love. </br></br>
 
Think about all data created in last 5 years.  Algorithms collect 'trace' data that is stored physically on a network of computers we call 'the cloud'. Oftentimes these computers are very far away from the producer of that data.  A credit card transaction in Milwaukee might be stored in a computer system chilled by AC in Henderson, Nevada. </br></br>

While data and digital feels spaceless, completely infinite, unphysical - storage of that data takes considerable amounts of space. This data is now stored in large warehouse centers / complexes, in what was virgin desert, valleys, and forests a handful of years ago. Today, Artifical Intellegence algorithims are trained on all of our human data generated, to produce synthetic media. Media that polarizes and divides. Media that depletes us all of our vitality. American politics is a circus, a reality television drama that capitivates the massess. Baby Boomers are addicted to identity politics as Zoomers are; and we must suspect that each and all in between are addicted to pornography. Pornography stored on computers housed in the once virgin earth. DreamHost is proud to host not safe for work (NSFW) content, and according to the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003842672-Data-center-FAQs" target="_blank">DreamHost Data Center FAQs</a> webpages, we are told that they host such content in  Ashburn Virginia and Hillsboro Oregon. Maybe some patriot can uncover where these are located? </br></br>

<div class="subheader"><a href="https://www.watercalculator.org/footprint/data-centers-water-use/" target="_blank">Check Out How Data Centers Chug Water!</a></div>


Data centers are water/energy hogs; their consumption of land and effect on local communities is clear. Data centers progress our atomization. Energy/water drains are clear. Why build so many data centers in places without abundant access to water? Water, energy, earth. Our data consumes these at mounting scale, it is constricting the earth's flow, your flow. Our collective realization of our one true potential. <br><br>

Google's data centers require energy, and a lot of it. They need massive amounts of electricity to make all our searches (and other activities we do on websites that use Google's data services, like Snaphat) possible. In 2021, the search giant used 3.3 billion gallons of water in the US alone.<a href="https://www.watercalculator.org/news/news-briefs/google-data-center-water/">Watch Google's Data Centers Chug Water!</a><br>

How much water individual data centers use is not generally well known. Call it an operational secret, or maybe it’s something the municipal water system serving the data center might want divulged, especially when the data center is located in a water scarce area where water resources are in stiff competition from other sectors like agriculture, residential development or even industrial users like power plant operators. In the days of dwindling water resources, a fight over water is a fight it’s best to be out in front of.<br>


Land, land, land. Some quotes taken from 
<a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50855355/">a KSL article</a> about a data center emergence in Eagle Mountain, Utah. A colorado based company acquires land for another data center in Eagle mountain.</br></br>

"We identified data centers early on as a way to employ residents, pay for the infrastructure of our growing city, and form partnerships to strengthen this close-knit community," Eagle Mountain Mayor Tom Westmoreland said in a statement. "Beyond the fiscal impact, our new technology neighbors have been great additions to our community and we look forward to working with partners like Tract to develop new campuses and expand our emergence as a tech hub while maintaining our small-town charm."</br></br>


"Data centers continue to migrate to campus deployments and the building blocks for land and power are getting bigger to keep pace with the underlying demand," Graham Williams, chief investment officer of Tract, said in the release. "Building on Utah's data center sales tax exemption and low power rates, Eagle Mountain has distinguished itself through thoughtful planning and having sufficient contiguous land to meet the campus needs of tomorrow. We appreciate the partnership with the city and look forward to accelerating responsible infrastructure for data center development."</br></br>

Check out that articles about Eagle Mountain, Utah. Watch the effects on local community development across American West. Now see the <a href="https://www.themesatribune.com/news/eastmark-rages-at-yet-another-data-mega-center/article_37192ff4-9619-11ee-a3fd-6f234a79abdf.html" target="_blank">Case of EastMark</a>. Taken from the linked article:  

"Eastmark: The 10-year-old community of 20,000 in southeast Mesa has become a vibrant neighborhood in a relatively short time. Look into Project Borelius (located nearby). Meta’s planned 2.5-million-square-foot hyperscale data center in Eastmark is expected to start operations early next year on 381 acres. “Enough with these massive box buildings. We need more retail space in this area, more grocery options. Not more industrial,” one commenter wrote."

￼
And more data centers being developed... </br></br>

These data centers storey the social media sites and technologies that polarize us and drown us in a sea of identity politics and senseless bickering. They are AI research companies that are developing generative Artifical Intelligence. It is time that we consider the scale and storage requirements of these machines? And think about the energy and water consumption. Shouldn't this be going to people, those who are most vulnerable and forgotten by our exploding system?</br></br>

Digital spaces require material/natural resources to produce and maintain. Synthetic media is pulling us apart. Maybe the solution is to throw our phones and laptops in the trash!!! But there must be other paths towards deceleration. These are ideas we need to take very seriously. Global fixes, Washington DC, California, will do nothing. It is at the level of the individual that transformative action occurs. But how? It's easy when you see how good life is without these technologies, but can anyone disconnect completely while connecting completely? What's keeping me here? What's keeping you here? <br><br><br>
