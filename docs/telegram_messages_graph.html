The very apologetic way in which these media reports the beheadings of civilians in Cabo Delegado by the Jihadists, leads me to agree with those who say that for the editors of these media, they see those killed as being due to their own fault, because they are the ones who have voted for FRELIMO knowing that it does not guarantee their own defense. For them, they think that the victims of the jihadists are to blame, because they are the ones who keep FRELIMO in power through their vote. The journalists who told me this thesis said that such pro-jihadist editors testify to the last elections of 2019, in which FRELIMO won in all 10 Mozambican provinces, likewise they voted for their presidential candidate, Filipe Nyusi. What leads me to believe in this version is that whenever I read such media I notice that they are always against FRELIMO and its President Nyusi, and always in favor of the Opposition, even if it is not doing good things, as is the case with RENAMO has always had civilians as its main target, both in the war that raged for 16 years and even in the one that raged between 2013 and 2016. The way they echo the atrocities of the jihadists, leads me to see such editors as not being patriotic. In the words of Frances Wright, from the USA, patriotism is a virtue.

Comment: Bilateral or multilateral? \u0026quot;They are not sure whether they prefer EU experts or bilateral relations with certain European countries,\u0026quot; an irritated Josep Borrell said in his statement to parliament. This is one of the reasons the EU mission was blocked, he said. Is this division within the government or does it simply say one thing publicly and one thing privately? Officially and publicly, Mozambique has asked the EU and SADC for help, and there have been a number of statements by foreign diplomats saying that there should be a formal role for SADC, the EU or the UN. But privately, Mozambique is telling diplomats that they just want bilateral support and don\u0027t want a formal role for international bodies, except to help people displaced by war. There is a similar division in rhetoric. The president and ministers repeatedly say the war is entirely due to foreign terrorism - which they carefully do not identify so as not to offend Frelimo-linked Muslims. But they know they will gain foreign support especially if they emphasize that they are fighting the new global enemy, the Islamic State. Josep Borrell\u0027s statement underscores the problem. Mozambicans know that the EU and UK will want to emphasize the root causes and also create large, autonomous structures that Mozambique cannot control. This is unacceptable. Thus, all agreements will be bilateral and will remain under Mozambican control. Mozambique wants equipment, money, air support, coastal protection and perhaps some elite foreign soldiers acting as \u201ctrainers\u201d but accompanying Mozambican troops.

While during attacks, some fighters insist to civilians that only government facilities and officials are the target, Amnesty International has found that fighters routinely kill civilians, loot their homes and then burn them using gasoline.32 Under international humanitarian law, civilians must never be attacked. Deliberate killing of civilians, looting and deliberate destruction of homes are serious violations of international humanitarian law and war crimes. Al-Shabaab fighters killed civilians with guns and machetes. A 75-year-old man - who fled the fighting in Naguvala, a village on the coast near the town of Quissanga - said those civilian men who fought Al-Shabaab were \u0026quot;beheaded\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;bitten\u0026quot;. Like many people who have experienced attacks by Al-Shabaab, he used two separate words, \u0026quot;beheaded\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;chopped\u0026quot; to differentiate between methods of killing. The first being a simple decapitation, the second mimicking the butchering of an animal during slaughter, which man described as being \u0026quot;split like a cow\u0026quot;. 33 Sometimes these decapitations occur en masse; in November 2020, the media reported that more than 50 civilians were killed at one time on a football field in Muidumbe.34 These actions were deliberately done to intimidate and frighten the population. One man, who had a job where he regularly drove a truck along the coast to Palma, said \u201cOn that road I could see dead bodies every day. These corpses were cut and decapitated. They could take parts of a human body... and take pictures. They shared them via WhatsApp. This was to show people what they were doing. I saw a lot of bodies. I was afraid. \u201d35 Attacks have not always occurred in large, populated areas. There have also been minor attacks on individuals and small groups that contribute to the climate of fear. One young woman told Amnesty International how on 23 July 2020 the civilian bus she and her husband were traveling on was stopped by Al-Shabaab fighters in the small village of Nguida on the N380 road. The fighters fired at the bus, and when it stopped they ordered everyone out, one by one, to be executed.

They carried with them, by instinct, the essentials for groceries, in bundles (ready-to-eat food, blankets, pans and money), above all. Hours later, there were two outbreaks of shootings, in Vila Sede, which lasted approximately two hours and stopped when the attackers hid in deserted houses. The military from Palma did not move to counterattack but another military contingent, coming from outside Palma, was urgently moved to Palma and made several blockades throughout the early evening. It is estimated that there are an average of 100 men in the alshabbab network at both ends and it is suspected that they have plans to escape, after the attacks, through the Phundanhar woods. Parallel to this action, there was aerial intervention by the Government military and there were at least 5 helicopters that flew over, with no target in sight because the population was mixed with possible arsonists. The streets where the bank branches operate were the epicenter of exchange of first shots with the use of firearms from land artillery and it is still premature to assess damage and physical losses, whether by the belligerents, perhaps, by the population itself. These attacks take place at a time when Palma was re-emerging in the last few hours, with the appearance of another huge boat carrying 9 vehicles of 10 tons each, containing food for resale.

The insurgents\u0027 prolonged attack on Palma demonstrates once again the inability of Mozambican forces to contain the insurgency. Government forces lack adequate training, operational leadership and coordination, and these deficiencies, coupled with the lack of a cohesive counterinsurgency strategy, resulted in a series of successful, high-impact insurgent attacks that hit northern Cabo Delgado since early 2020. As private companies and foreign investments were directly targeted in this latest attack, the Mozambican government is likely to be subject to renewed pressure by international allies and regional SADC powers to accept the deployment of foreign forces in a operational capability rather than just training. Furthermore, although direct clashes between the Defense and Security Forces (DSF) and ASWJ peaked on Saturday night, the insurgents are still in town on Monday, six days since they first set foot in Palma. Local sources reported intermittent clashes while the DSF conducted clearing operations. Unconfirmed reports say the insurgents received reinforcements, leading to renewed clashes in the city on Monday. Meanwhile, the president has yet to release an official statement or appear on TV since the attack began; all official statements on the situation in Palma came from Defense Ministry Spokesperson Omar Saranga.

Total had planned to start shipping domestic liquefied gas (LNG) in 2024; unofficially, this is down to 2025. Even a one-year delay means the first LNG shipments will be 2026 or 2027. This has contractual and cost implications. When these projects were first developed in 2010-5, it was assumed that the gas would come on stream in 2019 and be sold for 30 years - at 2,050. Gas is a fossil fuel and is under increasing pressure due to the climate crisis. The window is closing and the big gas sales after 2045 seem unlikely. Total\u0027s project went ahead because it has 11 million tonnes per year LNG contracts, ranging from 13 to 20 years, starting in 2024. Some of these contracts were signed before climate crisis activists began detecting the gas. There are eight different contracts, including Shell, Tokyo Gas and one of the project owners. So the hope is that some will accept the delay. But it seems that some will want to renegotiate their contracts, paying less and opting for shorter contracts. (Fitch has the full list of contracts at http://bit.ly/Moz-Fitch-LNG ) And if Total comes back, it will want to renegotiate its contract with the Mozambican government. Mozambique will have to pay what appear to be huge security costs and the costs of delay. This will drastically reduce government revenue, especially in the next decade. The problem is further compounded because it seems unlikely that ExxonMobil will go ahead with its repeatedly delayed part of the project. Banks, the gas industry and Mozambique\u0027s leaders whistle in the dark and desperately hope that governments will not agree to meet the 1.5 degree climate crisis target and that all gas will still be sold. But as the gas window closes due to climate change and costs rise due to the insurgency, the likely income for the Mozambican government and the Frelimo elite declines and declines further in the future.

Indeed, in 2017-2018 Australia received nine times the volume of cocaine by air cargo from South Africa than from any other country.\n\nMoreover, cocaine has been cropping up in container shipments from South Africa. In 2019 68kg of cocaine was found in a furniture shipment from South Africa and in another seizure 384kg was found. The large size of these shipments suggests that the South Africa-Australia route is regarded as safe and reliable.\n\nThe rise of the cocaine trade signalled a major change. The heroin came from Asia but the coca plant grows exclusively in Latin America, so this signalled that Latin American drug cartels were now getting involved too. Probably the key was the trade agreement signed in 2015 between Mozambique and Brazil. This greatly facilitated the import of containerised goods from Brazil and pretty quickly some of those containers were carrying cocaine. Again, the intention was to route the drug through Mozambique, Malawi and South Africa to final destinations in Europe, Australia and the USA.\n\nThis naturally captured the attention of the American authorities and in October 2018 Tanveer Ahmed, a Pakistani drug kingpin, was arrested in Mozambique thanks to an operation led by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Ahmed ran a major network in Mozambique dealing in heroin, cocaine and hashish. In 2020 he was extradited to the US.\n\nThis was followed in April 2020 by the arrest in Mozambique of Gilberto Aparecido Dos Santos, a really major Brazilian drugs boss linked to the Primeiro Comando da Capital (First Capital Command), Brazil\u2019s biggest and most powerful organised crime group. Dos Santos, who had been on the run from the Brazilian police for over twenty years, was accused of controlling a large-scale trade in cocaine and arms with ramifications throughout Latin America. He had apparently acquired bases in both Mozambique and South Africa.\n\nDos Santos was arrested, together with two Nigerian associates, at a Maputo luxury hotel in an operation in which the Mozambican police co-operated with the Brazilian federal police and, once again, the DEA. Dos Santos was immediately extradited to Brazil \u2013 the Brazilian air force sent a special plane to Maputo to pick him up.\n\nThe arrest of major druglords like Ahmed and Dos Santos was very much not the Mozambican way of doing things. In all previous time it could have been taken for granted that men like them would have paid off the Mozambican police, made handsome gifts to the Frelimo leadership and then gone happily about their business. What had changed these cosy arrangements was clearly the arrival on the scene of the DEA, an agency used to getting its way, with powerful back-up from the US authorities.\n\nMoreover, everything had changed as a result of the discovery in 2015-2016 of the $2 billion in secret loans organised by Guebuza. Aid donors were furious at the deliberate falsification of Mozambique\u2019s accounts. They cut their aid to support the Mozambican budget, causing a major financial crisis; made it clear that Guebuza had to go; and in general began to wonder what other scams had been practised upon their naive goodwill. In this new climate of distrust the drug trafficking \u2013 which donors had hitherto benignly ignored \u2013 stood out as another major scandal.\n\nIt was in this climate that Felipe Nyusi came to power in 2015. Guebuza, in classic African style, had been busy trying to amend the constitution so as to give himself a third presidential term but all thought of that disappeared once Mozambique defaulted on its debts due to the loan scandal.\n\nQuite clearly Nyusi needed to take his distance from Mohamed Suleman and other known druglords and, publicly at least, to deplore the drug trade and at least appear to support international efforts to disrupt the trade.", "to": 2}, {"arrows": "to", "from": 12, "title": "In all countries there has been excess mortality due to covid.", "to": 0}, {"arrows": "to", "from": 12, "title": "Quite honestly, but then that newspaper headline would not be correct...

Situation Summary IDPs from Palma in the framework of the attack on the village on 24 March continue to face insecurity, whether they remain in Palma district or try to reach safer areas. On 25 May, Cape Ligado received a report of an incident less than a week ago in which displaced civilians fleeing Palma by boat were ambushed by eight insurgents near Mitacata, on the northern coast of Macomia district . The insurgents threatened the displaced and, in response, the popular invaded the insurgents\u0027 boat and killed all eight attackers. In the district of Palma, the situation was no less distressing. On May 28, insurgents attacked Quiwiya, a coastal village about 15 kilometers north of Palma town. A video circulated on social media shows houses in the village on fire. The extent of damage has not been reliably reported. Until then, there were no reports of deaths. On the same day, in Muidumbe district, government forces and local militias launched a new offensive in Ntchinga, continuing the work that pro-government forces have been carrying out in the area during the month of May. The offensive ended on May 30, when military commanders on the ground requested reinforcement of the military materiel, but none was provided. This situation is indicative of the logistical limitations of the Mozambican government, as well as its difficulties in planning operations and sustaining territorial gains. The government troops involved withdrew to Mueda. No casualties were reported, but the offensive culminated in the capture of a number of weapons that were in the insurgents\u0027 possession. Government troops involved in the operation called themselves \u0027For\u00e7a Mariano Nhongo\u0027, possibly meaning a tribute or threat to the leader of the Renamo Military Junta. On May 29, at midday, the insurgents returned to Quiwiya and set fire to more houses. The total number of houses destroyed is not yet certain, but witnesses said the insurgents appeared to be intent on burning down every building in the village. By the end of the week, local reports made it clear that government forces did not remain in Namacande, capital of Muidumbe district. The government reoccupied the village on May 22 with great pomp and circumstance, using the operation to debut the new Gazelle helicopters of the Mozambican army. However, as noted in Cabo Ligado\u0027s previous weekly, there were always questions about whether the government had the resources to maintain Namacande for the long term. The village is now abandoned. New information about previous incidents also surfaced last week. On 22 May, clashes broke out between government forces and insurgents in the lower part of Palma, the area of the village closest to the main shelter for displaced people in Quitunda. Casualty estimates vary, but more conservative estimates suggest that four civilians and five insurgents were killed. Insurgents also set fire to 14 houses and a mosque in lower Palma. When confronted by the Defense and Security Forces, the insurgents retreated north along the road to Quiwiya and eventually Tanzania. On the night of 23 May in Chiure, an unknown individual stole the machine used in the district to issue identity documents to displaced civilians, replacing those lost to the attacks.

The fact also raised concerns about infiltration. If the machine ends up in the hands of the insurgents, it can be used to create more convincing disguises for the insiders. Incident Focus: Life in Macomia vs. Nangade Reports that arrived last week show different situations faced by civilians trying to rebuild their lives in districts susceptible to insurgent attacks. In the district capitals of Nangade and Macomia, civilians try to live their daily lives with the insecurity and adversities created by the conflict. With a third of displaced Palma residents surveyed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) saying they are unsure whether they would like to return home or not, the experiences of civilians in Nangade and Macomia are instructive as they offer some perspectives. about the challenges that displaced populations will face if and when they attempt to return to their communities of origin. In Nangade, the situation remains bleak. People displaced during the March 24 attack on Palma continue to reach the village on foot, including more than 60 IDPs who arrived on May 30th. The continued movement of people to Nangade is creating greater demand for resources and a growing concern that insurgents are infiltrating late-arriving fugitives. As a result, there is a significant influx of people leaving Nangade to points further south, even with new IDPs entering the village. According to IOM data, more than 6,000 people from Palma passed through Nangade on their way to other locations, while more than 17,000 remained in the district. Security remains tight and district government forces keep a close watch on the displaced communities for which they are responsible. Among those who moved from Nangade is the district administrator, a fact that caused consternation among those who stayed. However, education and health officials remain, at least in the district capital, and are supported by a small number of international organizations. After a period of government restriction, movement between Nangade and Mueda is again deregulated, allowing goods to enter the district capital more freely. The road is still heavily militarized, however, with at least ten checkpoints between Mueda and Nangade. In Macomia, infrastructure problems may be even worse than in Nangade, but the trend is far more positive. The village of Macomia was largely destroyed during occupation by insurgents in May 2020. Since it was reoccupied by government forces, civilians have gradually started to return to the village. A year after the insurgent occupation, however, civilians in the area still say basic state services are virtually non-existent. Health facilities in the village of Macomia have problems storing medicines, including basic items such as antimalarials. Pregnant women also lack access to prenatal care. In addition, security remains a major concern, with kidnappings reported on the outskirts of the village and passenger transport drivers expressing concern over the possibility of being ambushed by government forces on the road. However, those same drivers who travel between Macomia and Pemba report that many Macomia natives who live in the provincial capital still want to return home. The resources available in the fields and forests around Macomia village are still far greater than what is being offered to survivors of aid in Pemba, a fact that is leading more and more civilians to face a return to the interior areas of the district of Macomia.

As Namande is the last village in Muidumbe at the entrance to Mueda, the attack created a great stir in the village of the latter district, which, as is known, hosts the Command of the North Operational Theater (TON). The target village is approximately ten kilometers from the district town of Mueda. The attack in Muidumbe took place in exactly the same week that the Defense and Security Forces (FDS) announced the killing of more than 150 terrorists in the district of Palma, as well as the capture of many others and their collaborators. According to some natives of Muidumbe, who are in the city of Pemba and who spoke with relatives on the phone, at the entrance to Namande, the population thought they were elements of the local force, but in fact they were terrorists. Moments after entering the village, a confrontation between gang elements and the local force [militiamen] took place. Three militiamen are reported to have been killed during the confrontation, but some terrorists are believed to have been wounded. Also according to the sources, of the ten dead, six were by firearms and four by decapitation. This information was measured through images that circulated in some groups. In addition to deaths, injuries, destruction of homes and theft of property, there are also reports of people who remained missing until yesterday, believed to have been kidnapped by terrorists. Namande is part of the three villages of Muidumbe, which registered a considerable return of populations in response to appeals and security guarantees that have been transmitted by the Defense and Security Forces.

Our FDS, constantly humiliated by their Commander-in-Chief who does not properly equip them, does not consult them, apparently, to find out what they need to do better in their job of ensuring security, etc., will wonder why they should go after ambushes in the bush when they don\u0027t have half what the Rwandans have. Intelligence services will keep the information to themselves for fear that bad news will be interpreted as collusion with the enemy or lack of patriotism. Local populations will see their children killed (\u0026quot;cut down\u0026quot; in official language), will lay all the blame on the invaders \u0026quot;Lexi-Lexi\u0026quot; (thus those from the South), some parents will see their sources of income droughts as it will be difficult for the children to send part of the money they earn from participating in military actions against the SDS. One day, the French and Rwandans may wonder whether what they are doing makes sense and whether it would not be wiser to deal directly with local populations, even if it means creating a new country there. After all, they are not there for Mozambicans. They are there because of their economic interests. It was like that in northern Mali too. I have a former German colleague and friend who is a great researcher in that region. He knows many of the Tuareg leaders with whom he maintains contact. The French presence created an ideal space for the normalization of illegality. Young Tuareg made a living crossing the Sahara in a Land Cruiser full of guns and drugs. If they returned alive, it was USD10,000 and they could keep the car. Again, colonialism was not a project. It happened. Those innocent coastal enclaves (in Louren\u00e7o Marques, Luanda, etc.) were not outposts of any colonial project. But when the horizon got closer and people saw that more was possible, they became a safe back-end for \u201ceffective occupation\u201d. In Congo, King Leopold II had made several deals with various \u201ckingdoms,\u201d some of which were in exchange for a promise to offer cloth once a month. It must have been a lot for those who signed the contract on the African side. Not having mastery of history, or perhaps better still, not having historical awareness is exactly that. We think that history repeats itself, which is not true. The only thing that is repeated is stupidity because it is waiting for details when the historical movement respects standards. The best protection there is against the lack of domination of history is never to privatize a national affair. In the 19th century there was no Mozambique, so the chiefs of that time are even excused. Today Mozambique exists and formally meets each time the Assembly of the Republic meets. When the historians of our present one day write history, the \u201cprivatization of Cabo Delgado\u201d will be an important moment for whatever our relationship with others will be. Meanwhile, those who can make a difference wait patiently for the term to end because it feels bad to tell the person that inherently the job is the most intelligent, insightful, strategist and patriot that Moz has that he needs to do better and that he has to respect the people communicating with him.

On the same day at 3:00 pm, he had a greeting meeting with the Director of SERNIC/MAVAGO, where he sought to find out about the relationship between the Head of Operations and the Director of SERNIC. It should be noted that the team stayed overnight in this village, Mavago District, and left for Lichinga Today, 08/20/2021, when it was 05:00. On the way, after the Luatize river, approximately 08 km away from the main village of Mavago, they found a barricade on the road, and were then attacked.

Excellency! \u00bb", "to": 0}, {"arrows": "to", "from": 0, "title": "By El\u00edsio Macamo * The war in northern Mozambique gained new contours with the arrival of a Rwandan military contingent. In less than two weeks, he recovered, for example, Vila de Moc\u00edmboa da Praia, which had been in the hands of insurgents for a year. Only the Government, and the people affected, knew that. The Rwandan presence reveals the host country\u0027s military, but especially political, weaknesses. These weaknesses demonstrate that the Government of Mozambique is, in fact, its own worst enemy. When 1000 Rwandans do in two weeks what Mozambicans were unable to do in four years, the question that arises is: how is this possible? And the answer is simple. It\u0027s possible because in Mozambique you don\u0027t ask these kinds of questions. The notion of politics is not part of the national political vocabulary. It does not fit, in our political culture, the idea that politics only makes sense when it is interpreted as a commitment to creating conditions so that those who are bad in life are not even worse off because of the way the political system works. . It is an illiberal political culture that sees the individual as a means to something, not an end in itself. The violence began with an attack on a police station in 2017. The Police General Commander announced shortly afterwards that he would solve the problem in three days. Intensity violence with people killed, many displaced, economic enterprises abandoned and infrastructure destroyed. Its hierarchical superior, the President of the Republic, took four years to make an official statement to the nation. When he did, he didn\u0027t explain what had failed in his approach; did not apologize for not having protected as people; he did not speak of the way in which he was going to reorganize the Defense and Security Forces so that they would be in a position to guarantee the gains that foreign troops would bring. Nor did he say why he keeps the general commander of the Police, four years later. He just said that he had asked for help outside the country. He said that because in Mozambique a government is not responsible when it fails in its duty. And you never know if you failed because that kind of question doesn\u0027t get asked. The expectation is that people understand that a Government cannot do everything. It does not cross the mind of a member of the political elite that even recognizing the lack of means to equip the army, it is still necessary to explain how the few means are being used, if the people are in the right place and, above all, if there is any thing that could have been done so that the results weren\u0027t worse. Asking for help, rather than reflecting on what can be done better, is the greatest \u201cevidence\u201d of political irresponsibility. And that explains why 1000 Rwandans did in two weeks what Mozambicans couldn\u0027t do in four years. Some have a sense of responsibility. Others have no idea what this might be. * Full Professor of Sociology at the University of Basel EXPRESSO (Lisbon) - 20.08.2021", "to": 0}, {"arrows": "to", "from": 0, "title": "\u0027\u0027\u0027For $300,000, paid by the then Moz ambassador to China - now a top foreign ministry official despite a separate corruption conviction - Chinese investors were able to bypass environmental regulations and keep workers effectively stuck in the project.
