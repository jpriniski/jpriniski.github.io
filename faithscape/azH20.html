    <summary>Project Overview</summary>
    <p>
      Hunter’s website, <strong>azH2O</strong>, will crowdsource personal narratives of water memories and usage through a QR code installed on <em>“The Well.”</em> 
      Using state-of-the-art technology, the platform will visualize the stories embedded in users’ personal narratives, creating in real time 
      an interactive collective narrative about how Arizonans make sense of their relationship to water and their expectations for water policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As described in the User Story, the interactive data story <em>My Water, My Culture</em> motivates participation through giving and learning — hearing and being heard. 
      Users contribute their own data through narrative and, in exchange, learn about others’ connections to water. 
      Following the old adage: “give data, get a cookie; give more data, get a bigger cookie.”

    <summary>User Story</summary>
    <p><strong>AZWATER LIFE - User Story</strong></p>
    <p>A participant walks up to the well installation, scans a QR code, and is taken to a lightweight web app.</p>

    <p><strong>Phase 1: Question Input</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>They are asked to submit two questions about water:</li>
      <li>A word or phrase describing thoughts about water in Arizona</li>
      <li>A word or phrase describing feelings about water in childhood</li>
      <li>The system saves these responses and instantly shows an interactive network visualization linking their questions to others’.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Phase 2: Digital Network Survey</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>After exploring the network, participants complete a brief survey on their use of digital networks (frequency, purpose, etc.).</li>
      <li>Their responses are compared to aggregate public datasets (Pew Research, Statista), shown in static comparative graphs, along with an estimate of water usage derived from digital footprint data.</li>
    </ul>
